<h2 style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">Token Sale Terms & Conditions</h2>
<div style="padding:30px; padding-top: 10px; line-height: 1.2">
      <p>
        <p>The <strong>EMINENT</strong> (&ldquo;<strong>EMN</strong>&rdquo;) tokens are not securities as defined under Singapore&rsquo;s Securities and Futures Act (Cap. 289) (&ldquo;<strong>SFA</strong>&rdquo;). Accordingly, the SFA does not apply to the issuance of the EMN tokens. For the avoidance of doubt, the offering of EMN tokens need not be accompanied by any prospectus or profile statement and no prospectus or profile statement needs to be lodged with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (&ldquo;<strong>MAS</strong>&rdquo;).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This White Paper does not constitute an offer of, or an invitation to purchase, the EMN tokens in any jurisdiction in which such offer or sale would be unlawful. No regulatory authority in Singapore, including the MAS, has reviewed or approved or disapproved of the EMN tokens or this White Paper. This White Paper and any part hereof may not be distributed or otherwise disseminated in any jurisdiction where offering tokens in the manner set out this White Paper is regulated or prohibited.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The information in this White Paper is current only as of the date on the cover hereof. For any time after the cover date of this White Paper, the information, including information concerning BeepBeep Nation app&rsquo;s business operations and financial condition may have changed. Neither the delivery of this White Paper nor any sale made in the related token offering shall, under any circumstances, constitute a representation that no such changes have occurred. Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd., the entity that created the BeepBeep Nation app and the issuer of the EMN token, does not make or purport to make, and hereby disclaims, any representation, warranty, undertaking, or other assurance in any form whatsoever to any person, including any representations, warranties, undertakings, or other assurances in relation to the truth, accuracy, or completeness of any part of the information in this White Paper.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Whether taken as a whole or read in part, this White Paper is not, and should not be regarded as, any form of legal, financial, tax, or other professional advice. You should seek independent professional advice before making your own decision as to whether or not to receive any EMN tokens. You are responsible for any and all evaluations, assessments, and decisions you make in relation to investing in the EMN tokens. You may request for additional information from Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd. in relation to this offer of the EMN tokens. Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd. may, but is not obliged to, disclose such information depending on whether (i) it is legal to do so and (ii) the requested information is reasonably necessary to verify the information contained in this White Paper.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd is not responsible for compelling any person to accept EMN tokens and disclaims, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all liability for any adverse consequences arising out of or in relation to such rejections of the EMN tokens.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Upon receiving any EMN tokens, you will be deemed to have reviewed this White Paper (and any information requested and obtained from Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd.) in full and to have agreed to the terms of this offering of the EMN tokens, including to the fact that this offering does not fall within the scope of any securities laws in Singapore and is not regulated by the MAS. You further acknowledge and agree that the EMN tokens are not securities and are not meant to generate any form of investment return.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The EMN tokens and related services provided by Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd. (if any) are provided on an &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis. Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd. does not grant any warranties or make any representation, express or implied or otherwise, as to the accessibility, quality, suitability, accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of the EMN tokens or any related services provided by BeepBeep Nation app, and expressly disclaims any liability for errors, delays, or omissions in, or for any action taken in reliance on, the EMN tokens and related services provided by BeepBeep Nation app. No warranty, including the warranties of non-infringement of third party rights, title, merchantability, satisfactory quality, or fitness for a particular purpose, is given in conjunction with the EMN tokens and any related services provided by BeepBeep Nation app.</p>
        <h4>Regulatory risks</h4>
        <p>The regulation of tokens such as the EMN tokens is still in a very nascent stage of development in Singapore. A high degree of uncertainty as to how tokens and token-related activities are to be treated exists. The applicable legal and regulatory framework may change subsequent to the date of issuance of this White Paper. Such change may be very rapid and it is not possible to anticipate with any degree of certainty the nature of such regulatory evolution. Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd. does not, in any way, represent that the regulatory status of the EMN tokens will remain unaffected by any regulatory changes that arise at any point in time before, during, and after this offering.</p>
        <h4>No regulatory supervision</h4>
        <p>None of Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd. or its affiliates is currently regulated or subject to the supervision of any regulatory body in Singapore. In particular, Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd. and its affiliates are not registered with MAS in Singapore as any type of regulated financial institution or financial advisor and are not subject to the standards imposed upon such persons under the Securities and Futures Act, Financial Advisors Act, and other related regulatory instruments. Such persons are required to comply with a variety of requirements and standards concerning disclosures, reporting, compliance, and conduct of their operations for purposes or maximising investor protections. Since Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd. is not subject to such requirements or standards, it will make decisions on those issues at its own discretion. While Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd. will have regard to best practices on these issues, holders of EMN tokens may not necessarily enjoy the same extent and degree of investor protections as would be the case should they invest with regulated entities instead.</p>
        <h4>No fiduciary duties owed</h4>
        <p>As Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd. is not a regulated financial institution, it does not owe investors in EMN tokens any fiduciary duties. This means that Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd. has no legal obligation to always act in good faith in the best interests of holders of EMN tokens. While Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd. will have regard to the interests of holders of EMN tokens, it is also permitted to consider the interests of other key stakeholders and to prefer these interests over the interests of EMN token holders. This may mean that Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd. is permitted to make decisions that conflict with the interests of EMN token holders. Not owing any fiduciary duties to holders of EMN tokens also means that holders of EMN tokens may have limited rights of recourse against Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd. and its affiliates in the event of disputes.</p>
        <h4>Tax risks</h4>
        <p>The tax characterization of EMN tokens is unclear. Accordingly, the tax treatment to which they will be subject is uncertain. All persons who wish to receive EMN tokens should seek independent tax advice prior to deciding whether to receive any EMN tokens. Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd. does not make any representation as to whether any tax consequences may arise from purchasing or holding EMN tokens.</p>
        <h4>Risks from third parties</h4>
        <p>The tokenised nature of EMN tokens means that they are a blockchain-based asset. The security, transferability, storage, and accessibility of blockchain assets depends on factors outside of Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd.&rsquo;s control, such as the security, stability, and suitability of the underlying blockchain (in this case, the Ethereum blockchain), mining attacks, and who has access to the smart contract where the EMN tokens are stored. Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd. is unable to assure that it can prevent such external factors from having any direct or indirect adverse impact on any of the EMN tokens. Persons intending to receive the EMN tokens should note that adverse events caused by such external factors may results in the loss of some or all of the EMN tokens. Such loss may be irreversible. Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd. is not responsible for taking steps to retrieve EMN tokens lost in this manner.</p>
        <h4>Risks in receiving the EMN tokens</h4>
        <p>Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd. cannot and does not guarantee or otherwise assure that there are no risks in relation to the issuance of the EMN tokens. The EMN tokens may, depending on the manner in which the relevant issuance is effected, involve third parties or external platforms (e.g., wallets). The involvement of such parties or platforms may introduce risks that would not otherwise be present, such as misconduct or fraud by the third party, or your failure to receive the EMN tokens upon duly making payment because of a third-party wallet&rsquo;s incompatibility with the EMN tokens. Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd. is not responsible for any risks arising due to the involvement of third parties, including the risk of not receiving (or subsequently losing) any or all EMN tokens issued to you.</p>
